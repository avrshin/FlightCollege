<H2>Testing and Debuging TESS Wrappers</H2>
<P>You should always test your wrapper before considering it done.
There are often weirdness in the HTML that you don't notice otherwise. These
can usually be delt with rather easily by a slight modification of a
regular expression somewhere. To test your wrapper you can either use
the Makefile in the directory or just run the NativeWrapper class.
I'll give a brief introduction to doing both here.</P>
<H3>Using the Makefile</H3>
<P>To use the Makefile you need only supply the name of the wrapper
and optionally any arguments you want to pass in.</P>
<P>To test the <A HREF="example.html">google example</A> you would type
<PRE>
$ make test google.jsc "q=telegraph"
</PRE>
If you leave of the arguments it will just use the default arguments
you supply.</P>
<P>What gets printed when you run tests is what the wrapper is finding
as it searches.  It should look something like:
<PRE>
Parsed telegraph/source/tupleReader/URLScan/google.jsc successfully 

Args are: [q] -- [telegraph]
Target is: www.google.com/search?q=telegraph
Reading:www.google.com/search?q=telegraph
adding Electronic Telegraph | Front Page to column 0
adding Britain's biggest-selling broadsheet daily. to column 1
Done fetching page

adding www.telegraph.co.uk/ to column 2
Found: [Electronic Telegraph | Front Page, Britain's biggest-selling broadsheet daily., www.telegraph.co.uk/]
adding Electronic Telegraph | Front Page to column 0
adding www.telegraph.co.uk/home.html to column 2
Found: [Electronic Telegraph | Front Page, NULL, www.telegraph.co.uk/home.html]
adding Belfast Telegraph News to column 0
adding www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/ to column 2
Found: [Belfast Telegraph News, NULL, www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/]
adding The Daily Telegraph to column 0
adding www.dailytelegraph.co.uk/ to column 2
Found: [The Daily Telegraph, NULL, www.dailytelegraph.co.uk/]
</PRE>
What does all this mean?  The first thing that happens is that
google.jsc is parsed by the URLConfig class.  When it's finished it
prints out Parsed [yourfile] successfully.  It then prints out the target
page that it is going to try and fetch.  The PageBuffer then goes out
and starts fetching the page, since it does this in another thread you
notice that the results can start coming back before the page has been
fully fetched.  The scanner then outputs what it is adding to each
column and finally outputs a comma delimited list of each row as it
finds it.</P>
<P>If you want to use the main method of the NativeWrapper class you
need to provide it a .jsc file and optionally arguments (it's almost
the same as using the makefile).  You would do something like:
<PRE>
$ java NativeWrapper google.jsc "q=telegraph"
</PRE>
The advantage here is that you can specify the debug level.  (Once
it's supported)</P>
