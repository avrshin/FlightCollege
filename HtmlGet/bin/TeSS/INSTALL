WARNINGS:

1. This software is an alpha release made available for early
   dissemination only.  It is not a robust release and there are
   several  bugs.  Please contact the author for any problems;
   feedback is greatly appreciated. 

2. Code documentation and release notes are quite primitive.
   Hopefully these will get better soon.

3. Testing of wrappers is currently very difficult, methods to improve
   this are in the works.

4. Thanks for being a guinea pig. Be careful if this software is
   sending a probe to Mars.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:  This software should run on any platform that
supports java (version 1.2 or better).  It has currently only been
tested on RedHat Linux ver 6.2 and Debian Sid.  


REQUIRED SOFTWARE:
- Java version 1.2 or better (previous versions may work but have not
  been tested)
- gnu-regexp-1.0.8 or better.  See http://www.cacas.org/~wes/java/ for
  more information about the regexp library tess uses


INSTALL:
Since you're reading this I'll assume you've got the tarball
unpacked.  If for some reason you haven't you can do that by typing
tar -xzvf TeSS-0.1.tar.gz
in the directory you downloaded TeSS to.

For all these instructions I'm assuming you have TeSS in your home
directory.  If you don't you should replace all the references to
~/TeSS with the path to TeSS on your machine.

1. Add the gnu-regexp package to your classpath.
   For bash type shells type: 
   export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:~/TeSS/gnu-regexp-1.0.8.jar

   For csh type shells type:
   setenv CLASSPATH "$CLASSPATH"\:~/TeSS/gnu-regexp-1.0.8.jar

2. Compile TeSS.
   cd ~/TeSS
   make

3. If you don't get any errors you should be good to go.  You can run
   a brief test by typing make runurlt, you should see something like
   the following:


$ make runurlt
java TeSS.NativeWrapper google.jsc
Row Prefix is ^<p>
Parsed google.jsc successfully

If you get something similar there is a very good chance TeSS is
working properly.  Now you can go read the wrapper documentation to
figure out how to write wrappers for the infomation you really want.
