<H2>Advanced TESS Wrapper writting</H2>
<P>This page will deal with custom scriping for TESS wrappers.
Knowledge of <A HREF="http://java.sun.com">java</A> is assumed.  It builds on the <A
HREF="example.html">previous example</A> so if you haven't read that
yet I recommend you do.</P>
<P>You may have noticed in our previous example that we only get the
first ten results back, but what if we want to get all the results
google has for the telegraph query.  To do this you need to write a
custom java class to follow the links at the bottom of the page.
Something to note for situations like these is that there is often a
parameter in the query that specifies the number of results per
page.  Although the user interface often only allows preset values to
be specified for that parameter you can often just supply it with a
really huge number to get back all the results at once.  Sadly, google
does not let us do this so we need to write a custom script. (Can can
actually give it a num parameter as in "q=telegraph&num=100" but it
won't return more than 100 results at a time so we can't get
everything in one shot)</P>
<P>All custom scripts need to extend the AbstractURLScan class.  There
is only one abstract method that you have to override, getNextRow(),
which returns the next row of results from the scan as an array of
objects.  You also need to create a .jsc file that tells TeSS to use
the script you wrote.<BR><BR>
So without further adieu lets start writing our script... 
</P>
<P>To start with create an ordinary class file that extends
AbstactURLScan:
<PRE>
class GoogleScan extends AbstractURLScan {
</PRE>
Now we need to write the constructor.  The constructor of an
AbstractURLScan takes a URLConfig and a SQLProperties.  The URLConfig
is the file that was parsed to create the script (explained later) and
the SQLProperties is a list of name value pairs of the arguments to
the scan.</P>
<P>We want to grab all the results from google.  By looking at
the urlbar when we click to the next set of results we notice that
google uses the start=x argument to figure out which results to give
back, we can exploit this.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="google3.jpg"><BR>
<B>The urlbar after clicking next on the search.  The start argument is circled</B></CENTER>
<BR>Our script will scan one page and then restart the scan after that
page is finished but with the start argument incremented by 10. (We
could improve performace a little by getting more results back per
page, this is left as an exercise for the reader)</P>
<P>The first thing we need to do is modify our script to use the start
argument.  We'll create a new .jsc file called google_script.jsc (the
_script indicates that this is a file that is just used by a script
and is not a standalone wrapper, this is in no way nessecary for TeSS
but it helps keep all your .jsc files strait). So out new
google_script.jsc looks like:
<PRE>
host=www.google.com
url=/search?
method=get
<B>arguments=q,start,</B>
default1=telegraph
<B>default2=0</B>
columns=name,description,url,
prefix=seconds
rowprefix=^&lt;p&gt;
rowterm=Similar pages
name_prefix=&lt;A HREF=[^&gt;]*&gt;
name_term=&lt;/A&gt;
description_prefix=Description:
description_term=&lt;br&gt;
url_prefix=font color=green&gt;
url_term=-
description_nullifmissing
termination=&lt;div class=nav&gt;
end
(changes in bold)
</PRE>
Now we can start to write our classfile.<BR>
Let's write the constructor first.  What we want to do is take the q
argument the script was given and use them as the arguments to our
scan. We will be constructing multiple scans, one for each page, so
all we really need to do in the constructor is set up the config file
by scaning google_script.jsc...
<PRE>
class GoogleScan extends AbstractURLScan {

  URLConfig murlConfig = null;
  URLScan curscan = null;
  int cstart = 0;
  SQLProperties props = null;

  /** Just set up the URLConfig that this scan will use. */
  public GoogleScan(URLConfig urlConfig, SQLProperties p) {
    try {
      murlConfig = new URLConfig(new File("google_script.jsc"));
    }catch(Exception e) {e.printStackTrace();}
    props = p;
  }
</PRE>
Notice that we don't do a super here. You only need to do a super if
you're planning on using the script file and all properties that the
_script.jsc file uses.
</P>
<P>Now we need to write our getNextRow() method.  What this needs to
do is return the next result.  When it reaches the end of one page of
results we want to start a new scan on the next page.  To do this we
will use an auxiliary private method called getNextScanner.  It will
create a new URLScan each time it is called with the argument for
start increased by ten.
<PRE>
package telegraph.source.tupleReader.URLScan;

import java.io.*;
import telegraph.util.*;
import telegraph.util.exceptions.*;

class GoogleScan extends AbstractURLScan {

  URLConfig murlConfig = null;
  URLScan curscan = null;
  int cstart = 0;
  SQLProperties props = null;

  /** Just set up the URLConfig that this scan will use. */
  public GoogleScan(URLConfig urlConfig, SQLProperties p) {
    try {
      murlConfig = new URLConfig(new File("telegraph/source/tupleReader/URLScan/google_script.jsc"));
    }catch(Exception e) {e.printStackTrace();}
    props = p;
  }

  public Object[] getNextRow() 
    throws GeneralTelegraphException {
    
    Object[] o = null;
    if(curscan == null)
      getNextScanner();
    if(curscan == null)
      return null;  /* A return value of null indicates the scan is completely finished */
    
    if((o = curscan.getNextRow()) != null)
      return o;
    else {
      curscan = null;
      return getNextRow();
    }
  }

  private void getNextScanner() {
    
    if(cstart > 990) {
      curscan = null;
      return;
    }
    props.removeProperty("start");
    props.addProperty("start",""+cstart); /*Need to make the int a string */
    cstart+=10;
    try {
      curscan = new URLScan(murlConfig, props);
    }catch(GeneralTelegraphException e){e.printStackTrace();}
  }
	
} 
</PRE>
This will keep returning results from google until cstart==1000 which
is the highest number google will let you start your results from.  We
now have a script that will do exactly what we want; return all
results from a google search.</P>
<P>The last thing left to do is write the .jsc file that uses this
script.  Fortunatly writing this is much easier than writing a full
blown wrapper. Here's the full text of the .jsc file:
<PRE>
columns=name,description,url,
script=telegraph.source.tupleReader.URLScan.GoogleScan
end
</PRE>
That's it! Nothing else to write.  All this does is tell TeSS
to use a script that is in the classfile GoogleScan and that the
columns it will be returning are name, description, and url.  The rest
is taken care of by the other google wrapper we wrote so we don't need
anything else.  TeSS will warn you that you have not specifed some
tags that are usually required by a wrapper but you can ignore them
since this wrapper doesn't need them.</P>
<P>Wrapper/Script writting can be a tricky buissness and you will
probably find yourself doing some ugly hacks.  TeSS tries to provide
some functions that let you handle the variable nature of HTML as
elegantly as possible, however some things simply cannot be handled in
a general way and you will have to write specific hacks for them. If
you think that some fuctionality in TeSS could make your life a lot
easier <A HREF="nickl@db.cs.berkeley.edu">mail me</A> and it might
become a feature.
