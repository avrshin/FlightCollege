<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR><TD>
<A NAME="host">
<B>host</B>
</TD><TD>
This is the host that you want your wrapper to contact.  This is not a
fully specified url.  If you wanted to look at the page
www.google.com/linux/search.cgi  you would specify www.google.com
here.</TD><TR><TD>
<A NAME="url">
<B>url</B></TD><TD>
This is the resource that you want to retrieve on the remote host.  If
you wanted www.google.com/linux/search.cgi you would specify
/linux/search.cgi here.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<A NAME="method">
<B>method</B></TD><TD>
<LI>get
<LI>post
<LI>questionmark
This tells tess what method you want to use to send the query data to
the remote host.  There are currently three options.<BR>
get performs an html get request by appending &property=value for each
argument.<BR>
post will create a post string out of all the arguments and post it to
the server.<BR>
questionmark will simply append the argument(s) after a questionmark
to the url string.  If you know of another way of sending query data
send it in, we would certainly like to support as many ways of doing
this as possible.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="middle">
<A NAME="arguments">
<B>arguments</B></TD><TD>
A comma delimited list of arguments that you want to send in the
query.  These should be obtained from the html form that sends in the
query you want to run.  Text inputs need not be specified, however,
checkboxes, radio buttons, and select menus usually all have to be
specified.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A NAME="columns"><B>columns</B></TD><TD>
A comma delimited list of the coulmns that this scan will return.  You
must specify delimeters for all the columns in this list</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A NAME="defaultx"><B>defaultx</B></TD><TD>
The default value for argument x.  This list is 1 indexed so if your
list looks like argument=arg1,arg2,arg3 then default1=blah sets arg1's
default value to blah.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A NAME="prefix"><B>prefix</B></TD><TD>
A regular expression specifying the text that delimits the start of the
TeSS table.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A NAME="termination"><B>termination</B></TD><TD>
A regular expression specifying the text that delimits the end of the
TeSS table.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A NAME="rowprefix"><B>rowprefix</B></TD><TD>
A regular expression that specifies the text that starts each row.
This will only be searched for after the prefix text has be found and
after the prefix appears in the result text.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A NAME="rowterm"><B>rowterm</B></TD><TD>
A regular expression that specifies the text that ends each row.
After the start text is found the end text is searched for and
everything in between is considered a row and searched through for
columns.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><A
NAME="columnincludesignature"><B>columnincludesignature</B></TD><TD>
Tells TeSS that it should include the signature for all columns.<BR>
For example:<BR>
If you had colname_prefix=a and colname_term=b and the row looked
like<PRE>
this is a really big row</PRE>
then if columnincludesignature is not specified colname would be
<PRE> really </PRE> but if it was specified it would be
<PRE>a really b</PRE></TD></TR>
