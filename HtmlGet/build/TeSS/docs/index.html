<P>Welcome to the tess homepage.  TESS is the TElegraph Screen Scrapper.
It is part of <A HREF="http://telegraph.cs.berkeley.edu">The Telegraph
Project</A> at UC Berkeley.  TESS is a program that takes data from
web forms (like search engines or database queries) and turns it into
a form that is useable by a database system.  It currently returns
results as arrays of Objects although plans for JDBC functionality
exist</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
